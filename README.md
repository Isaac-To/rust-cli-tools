# RUSTY ways of implementing basic UNIX CLI tools

As a way to learn *rust* what better way than to re-implement some of the tools I use on a day-to-day basis as a programmer?

Currently:
- echo
- cat

have been implemented and should be available to download in the releases section should you choose to test them out. They aren't very well tested or even well written (mostly a proof of concept as I wrap my head around rust) but should work for most operations. They conform as best as I can using my current skills to the original versions with identical arguments & etc.

*I won't be doing active maintenance or support at all so use at your own risk*
